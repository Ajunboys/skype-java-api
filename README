This project is a mavenization and release of Skype4Java with some bug fixes.

The main idea is to use as a maven dependency, since it is deployed on maven central. To use it,
just add the following to your pom.xml dependencies:

<dependency>
	  <groupId>com.github.taksan</groupId>
	  <artifactId>skype-java-api</artifactId>
	  <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>

I'll make a shade jar release as well, which will make it possible to use it as a standalone version,
but I strongly advise you to learn maven if you don't already know it, since it will be a lot easier
to use this library.
